# Australia Wildfire Dashboard

This project is a Dash-based interactive dashboard that visualizes wildfire data across various regions in Australia. The dashboard allows users to explore wildfire statistics such as the estimated fire area and the count of pixels for presumed vegetation fires by selecting different regions and years.

## Features

- **Region Selection**: Users can select a region in Australia (e.g., New South Wales, Northern Territory) using radio buttons.
- **Year Selection**: Users can choose the year to analyze the data using a dropdown menu.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: The dashboard provides two key visualizations:
  - A pie chart showing the monthly average estimated fire area.
  - A bar chart displaying the average count of pixels for presumed vegetation fires.
